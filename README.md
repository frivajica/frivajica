# Hi, I'm Fran!

## About me
### I'm a happily IT dabbler, focused on React and familiar with Back-End technologies like Express, Passport, Sequelize and MySQL.
<br>

### I have professional experience working with data and love relational databases. I have had the opportunity to provide solutions based on my knowledge and imagination that have facilitated the workflow of my colleagues and work superiors, allowing them to make clearer decisions.  
### With many hours of professional and personal experimentation I am familiar with SQL and data relationships and flow between technology stacks.
<br>

### In addition, with a background in auditing and quality, I am able to recognize how my work is related to that of my colleagues, understand that my outputs translate into their inputs and have a vision of processes where our work is a system that can and must work synergistically.
<br>

### Out of the formal stuff, I really love building and improving software, not just making it work, but making it accessible and efficient.
<br>

## Recent experience and learning
### Right now I've been working with ReactJs/NextJs and Firebase in my current job. I'm willing to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails or Python really soon and have some interest on fast languages such as Go and Rust, but not currently working with them.
